platinum + color-treated diamonds

This unique setting of colored diamonds was inspired by and named in honor of Hans Hollein, the contemporary architect of the famous Juwelier Schullin store in Vienna, Austria. In the Hollein ring, tubes of various lengths and diameters are loosely stacked and encircled within a dome structure. Cutout piercings in the shank echo the tubes that effervesce above. Playing with the same concept, the Hollein necklace and earrings are equally whimsical yet stunning.
