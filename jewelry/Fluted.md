Lavish yet seemingly simple, the Fluted design is a modern tribute to the fashionable Elizabethan collar known as the ruff. The metal radiates from the center and serpentines seductively creating spatial opportunities for showcasing gemstones or flashing reflections in negative space. Fit for royalty, the Fluted earrings were worn by actress Alison Pill at the 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards.
