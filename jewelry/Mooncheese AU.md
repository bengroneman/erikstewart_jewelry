The Mooncheese suite is as pure in form and texture as the materials that make it. Sculpted by meteorites and unearthing a natural rough uncut diamond, this suite takes every-day jewelry to extraordinary dimensions. It’s incredible how the concave sur faces in the metal transform the simple design into dynamic jewelry with a minimal number of gemstones. Natural diamond color and shape are unique to each piece.
