    Erik Stewart began his career in the jewelry industry at the age of 13, developing
    foundation skills at the bench. Erik Stewart received formal training at the Gemological
    Institute of America and is a certified Graduate Gemologist (2003). Trained in
    Matrix, Erik uses computer aided design software to **enhance precision, create
    clean lines, and achieve world-class workmanship.** Erik Stewart collaborates

    Erik’s design concepts stem from the vivid imagery from his engagements with music, visual and performing arts (wife is a dancer), food, and travel. His strong affinity for **geometry within nature, minimalistic elegance, and transforming complexity into simplicity** are significant motifs in all of his jewelry. The ESJ brand is **innovative, conceptual, and dynamic.**

    With the objective of **challenging and expanding notions of jewelry design** by the jewelry industry, retail market, and himself, Erik Stewart welcomes every publishing/educating opportunity. Areas of expertise that he can speak on include: **jewelry design, design process, jewelry aesthetics, computer aided design (Matrix), gemology, and the relationship of architecture and jewelry.**
