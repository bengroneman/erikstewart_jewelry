  content: "<p>Erik’s design concepts stem from the vivid imagery from his engagements
    with music, visual and performing arts (wife is a dancer), food, and travel. His
    strong affinity for <strong>geometry within nature, minimalistic elegance, and
    transforming complexity into simplicity</strong> are significant motifs in all
    of his jewelry. The ESJ brand is <strong>innovative, conceptual, and dynamic.</strong>
    With the objective of challenging and expanding notions of jewelry design by the
    jewelry industry, retail market, and himself, Erik Stewart welcomes every publishing/educating
    opportunity. Areas of expertise that he can speak on include: <strong>jewelry
    design, design process, jewelry aesthetics, computer aided design (Matrix), gemology,
    and the relationship of architecture and jewelry.</strong></p>"
